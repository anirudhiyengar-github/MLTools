## Tools Description

Here are a few tools that helped me in making the process of comparing different object detection algorithms easier. They have been labeled according to their functions. One issue I had when comparing YOLO and SSD was converting the image coordinates to match those of the darknet system from SSD, and vice versa.

Reading the values in the same is what helps me optimize my executable files. Albeit , this doesn't save a lot of time since it doesn't have to be compiled. I have personally saved a lot of space on GOOGLE COLAB since the free version obviously restricts space and everyone loves to have free storage. 

ML Tools is basically an effort to condense the code to have easier runtime efficiency too. I will be commiting new changes with results from testing these tools on Python IDE's incase that helps verify my preface.
